# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains a TypeScript-style technical specification representation of the U.S. Constitution. The main file `us_constitution.md` presents constitutional articles and sections as TypeScript interfaces, classes, and functions.

## Project Structure

- `us_constitution.md` - The main document containing the Constitution represented as TypeScript code

## Development Notes

This is a creative documentation project that represents legal/governmental structures as code. When working with this repository:

1. Maintain the TypeScript-style syntax for consistency
2. Preserve the formal structure of constitutional articles and sections
3. Use appropriate TypeScript constructs (interfaces, classes, functions) to represent governmental concepts
4. Keep code comments minimal - let the structure and naming convey meaning

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript syntax for all constitutional representations
- Interfaces for structural definitions (e.g., `Representative`, `Senator`)
- Functions for processes and eligibility checks
- Classes for institutional bodies (e.g., `HouseOfRepresentatives`)
- Maintain consistency with existing naming conventions (camelCase for properties, PascalCase for types)
